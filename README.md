Evaluating the Wandering Mindâ€™s Role in Learning: An Extension Study


Previous research has suggested that mindwandering can be detrimental to learning and attention. 
However, the attentional resources theory of mindwandering proposes that mindwandering can run 
parallel to cognitive processes which do not require attention. A recent study conducted by 
Brosowsky et al. (2020) supported this theory, finding evidence that mindwandering interfered with 
explicit, but not implicit, motor sequence learning during a serial reaction time task. To test if 
the finding generalizes to other types of learning, the current study used a perceptual sequence 
learning serial reaction time task with a similar paradigm to Browsosky et al. (2020). Bayesian 
linear models indicated that mindwandering interfered when participants were explicitly, but not 
implicitly practicing the perceptual training sequence. Additionally, this study found no evidence to 
support perceptual sequence learning occurring implicitly, nor mindwandering having a detrimental 
effect on explicit learning. Implications for a nuanced approach to mindwandering and learning are 
discussed, as mindwandering may have differential effects on different learning tasks.
